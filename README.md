## Blog (Markdown + KaTeX)

Storage-only posts in Supabase:

1. In Supabase project (same as DreamSprint), run the migration to create the bucket and policies:

```
-- SQL in supabase/migrations/20250831_add_blog_md_bucket.sql
```

Or apply manually:

```
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public)
values ('blog-md', 'blog-md', true)
on conflict (id) do nothing;
-- policies are in the migration file
```

2. Create folder `posts/` inside bucket `blog-md` (optional; the app writes to `posts/slug.md`).

3. Set env vars:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

Routes:
- `/blog` list posts
- `/blog/new` editor (requires auth to publish)
- `/blog/:slug` view

git clone git@github.com:Thabhelo/three.git
cd three
```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
